# Tomasz Topo≈Ça
Another dev without degree. I code for fun and share my ideas and projects on [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@tomektopola). For now my content is only in Polish, but maybe some day I'll be brave enough to start an English chanel.

## Projects
When I'm bored I have fun making electronic devices, mobile apps and more. Just take a look!

### [My own linktr.ee](https://github.com/TomaszTopola/tomasztopola.github.io)
As TikTok creator I came across a big problem - TikTok blocks linktr.ee links and my followers didn't reach my GitHub, YouTube and other important sites. That's why I made a simple site with GitHub Pages. Just [check it out](https://tomektopola.techtok.pl/)!

### [CustomLocations](https://github.com/TomaszTopola/CustomLocations)
That's a minecraft plugin which allows players to save their locations with a command and then teleport there. It's also possible to make a global location. Fun thing is that when I was making that plugin I didn't know what a database is so it stores all data in .yaml files

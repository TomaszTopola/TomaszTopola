# Tomasz Topo≈Ça
Another dev without a degree. I code for fun and share my ideas and projects. 

## Projects
When I'm bored I have fun making electronic devices, mobile apps and more. Just take a look!

### [Gym lift load controller](https://github.com/TomaszTopola/Gym-lift-load-controller)
This simple piece of software was made for an arduino project of mechatronics undergraduate. It uses voice recognition software to change weights on a gym lift. It also has a matrix keyboard input to enter specific weight in kgs.

### [CustomLocations](https://github.com/TomaszTopola/CustomLocations)
That's a minecraft plugin which allows players to save their locations with a command and then teleport there. It's also possible to make a global location. Fun thing is that when I was making that plugin I didn't know what a database is so it stores all data in .yaml files.
